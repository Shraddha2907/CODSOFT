# Python Data Science Projects  

Welcome to the **Python Data Science Projects Repository**! This repository contains a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level data science projects that showcase the use of Python for predictive modeling and machine learning.  


## Overview  
This repository highlights practical implementations of data science workflows including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building using popular Python libraries.  


## Projects  

### Movie Rating Prediction  
**Goal:** Predict the rating of movies based on features such as genre, cast, director, budget, etc.  

**Key Features:**  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and transformation  
- Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)  


### Iris Flower Classification  
**Goal:** Classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on petal and sepal dimensions.  

**Key Features:**  
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn  
- Implementation of classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics  


### Sales Prediction  
**Goal:** Predict future sales based on historical sales data and external factors such as promotions and holidays.  

**Key Features:**  
- Time-series analysis and trend detection  
- Feature engineering for categorical and temporal data  
- Implementation of models like Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting
  

## Technologies Used  
The following Python libraries are used across the projects:  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
